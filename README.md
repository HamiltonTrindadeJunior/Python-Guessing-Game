PythonGuessing Game

This is a simple guessing game in which the player must guess a number between 1 and 10 in a certain number of attempts. The game's graphical interface was created using the tkinter library in Python.

How to Play:

Run the python file.

The game window will be opened.

Enter a number in the input box and press the "Teste" button.

If the entered number is equal to the secret number, a congratulations message will be displayed. Otherwise, a message indicating whether the secret number is greater or smaller will be displayed, along with the number of remaining attempts.

The player will have 5 attempts to guess the secret number.

If the player runs out of attempts, a message will be displayed with the secret number.

To start a new game, press the "Jogar Novamente" button.

Prerequisites:

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine and have the "random" and "tkinter" libraries installed. You can install them using the following command in the terminal:

pip install random tkinter
